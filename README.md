# Primordial Particle System (PPS)

An (incomplete) implementation of a PPS as described [here](https://gitlab.com/thomasschmickl/primordialparticlesystems_public). This implementation uses Haskell and Gloss


``` sh
# Build the project.
stack build

# Run the test suite.
stack test

# Run the benchmarks.
stack bench

# Generate documentation.
stack haddock
```

Thanks again, and happy hacking!
